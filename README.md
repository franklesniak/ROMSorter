# ROMSorter
A scripted, repeatable, customizable approach to sorting ROMs for video game emulation.

## Arcade Emulation and ROM-Sorting
Please read the [Arcade Emulator Background Info page](./ARCADE_EMULATOR_BACKGROUND_INFO.md) before getting started; it includes required background information.
If you are analyzing or sorting ROM packages, or if you are building a ROM list for an arcade system, the process will not make much sense unless you read the background page.
